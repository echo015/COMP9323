      "What is web app testing?\nWeb testing, or web application testing, is a software practice that ensures quality by testing that the functionality of a given web application is working as intended or as per the requirements. Web testing allows you to find bugs at any given time, prior to a release, or on a day-to-day basis. \nTesting is a highly important part of software development. Whenever there’s a change in the code, no matter how small, bugs can appear somewhere else in the system. The cost of fixing these bugs also rises with time, so having effective web testing in place will ensure you’re time and money in the development of your application.\nHow to test web applications?\nBy automating web application tests, testers are able to save time and effort on monotonous tasks because automated tests can be run continuously or scheduled at intervals. By offloading testers from these time-consuming tasks, they can focus on exploratory testing or other tests that require a human perspective.",

      "Performance is one of the key factors of web application success. Nowadays, users expect constant availability and immediate response following their actions. To meet those expectations, many new performance enhancement techniques have been created. We have identified almost twenty such techniques with various levels of implementation complexity. Each technique enhances one or more tiers of the application.\n Our goal was to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of such techniques when applied to finished products (we used three popular open source applications). We argue that it is possible to significantly enhance the performance of web applications by using even a small set of performance enhancement techniques. \nIn this paper we analyse these techniques, describe our approach to testing and measuring their performance and present our results. Finally, we calculate the overall efficiency of each technique using weights given to each of the measured performance indicators, including the technique implementation time.",
